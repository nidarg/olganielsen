    title: "Why a lawyer?",
    content: `I decided to pursue a career in law at the age of 14 or 15, I don‚Äôt remember the exact age.But at that time I was also interested in a career in the army or police force.Something about law and being a lawyer has fascinated me.\nSo, I became a lawyer.\nLater I found out through numerology that it was destined to be, I guess üòä\nAfter completing five years at the university and becoming a lawyer, I recognized that my approach was distinct due to my business and work experience and my practical approach to complex areas.I do not align with the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù perception of a lawyer.\nThose who have collaborated with me understand what I mean.\nIf you are interested to find out, please feel free to reach out.`

    title: "Which area of law caught your interest?",
    content: `My introduction to the fields of data protection and information security happened while working on a significant project in the public sector, and this was prior to GDPR.This experience allowed me to understand the intersection of legal, information security, and organizational processes.A perfect combination I must say.\nI had already a lot of experience and training due to my previous education and jobs.\nSo, I discovered my passion for this area; its complexity and multidisciplinary nature resonated deeply with me and suited my personality perfectly.Since then, I have continually pursued further education and training, finding that as the field has grown more involved, my interest and enthusiasm have only increased.\nNow I have more than 10 years of experience in the field of GDPR and InfoSec.I have worked among others with AI projects, data-driven marketing, and cookie compliance since 2018.Having my focus on the EU Digital Strategy, additional areas caught my interest: AI Act, NIS2, DORA, CER, Data Governance Act, Cyber Resilience Act, Data Act, Digital Services Act, European Health Data Space.I work with ISO-standards, NIST, CIS, ENISA standards.\nDepending on the specific projects for which I am hired, either in an advisory capacity or as a hands-on project manager, I may also need to comply with other laws, including eIDAS, The Money Laundering Act, and the Public Administration Act.While my journey began with GDPR, it's not all about GDPR anymore.`

    title: "Have you always been an external consultant?",
    content: `I transitioned rapidly from employment in the public sector to establishing my first consulting firm.\nIn 2016, I became the first Data Protection Officer (DPO) in Denmark to offer DPO as a Service.I take pride in this achievement, particularly because, at that time, few people understood the role of a DPO or were familiar with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).The concept of GDPR was known to some extent, but its exact implications and implementation methods were not widely understood.\nPresently, many organizations still find it challenging to fully embrace and respect the role of a DPO, even those of considerable size.`

    title: "Why self-employed?",
    content: `I made a deliberate decision to alternate between being employed in-house and self-employment as a means of accelerating my learning curve.\nThis is how I felt to be the perfect solution for me.\nCurrently, I find that I have greater satisfaction from being self-employed.\n\nBeing hired to fix a problem in the organization is quite a challenge but also an amazing opportunity to apply years of experience, and see a final result of your advice or hands-on solutions ‚Äì this motivates me a lot.`

    title: "What are the benefits of this job and also being self-employed?",
    content: `I value the flexibility to manage my time, select my projects, and choose my collaborations.The more complex area or project the better it is for me.\nI experience increased motivation and job satisfaction by engaging in work that aligns with my personal interests, passions, and area of expertise.The necessity to remain engaged and continually improve my skills aligns well with my personality and current stage of life.\nI now prioritize my own physical and mental health before saying yes to a project.\nHowever, I must say that it has not always been this way.`

    title: "What are the disadvantages of this job?",
    content: `Well, like anything else, there are always pros and cons.Now it depends on how you want to look at it.\nAnd in this profession, there are cons on both professional and personal sides.\nThe industry has changed a lot.I experience a lack of consultants that are engaged, not as much as me, I don‚Äôt expect that, but at least share the same passion.I appreciate a lot when through circumstances I find people with the same smile on their faces when talking about this field.However, it is not only about the passion, it is also a lot about the level of expertise and not being accountable for the poor advice that is given out there.This trend often leaves companies with inadequate compliance guidance.My advice for companies is to perform due diligence and hire insured professionals.\nOn a personal note, I experienced burnout.I have not spoken publicly about this, as it has been a challenging period in both my professional and personal life.It is often said that individuals do not leave their company or job, but rather leave due to poor management.And maybe it is not always true.I guess we all have a responsibility for our own mental health.It has been challenging for me to acknowledge burnout and follow my doctor's advice to take a break.Instead, I moved to another demanding in-house job and very soon after I found myself attending interviews for other positions.It became increasingly evident that a personal transformation was essential for me to either continue in this field or explore other opportunities.\nAlthough efforts were made to hide burnout from colleagues and contacts, the condition worsened.Therefore, it is important to listen to your body and recognize when it is necessary to take a step back.\nIt is acceptable to do so.I am thankful now that I‚Äôve experienced that ‚Äì I value everything much more than before.I exercise regularly and I meditate a lot.\nI find those very helpful for my personal and professional life.`

    content: `Better to read their own words:\n 
‚ÄúOlga is an open and warm person, whose human view embraces everyone. A special remark: Her sense of humor is fantastic! When chatting on coffee break, when just saying a quick hello while rushing from meeting to meeting or back from lunch break‚Ä¶ And I miss her smile and sparkling laughter!‚Äù\n

‚ÄúI have had the pleasure of working closely with Olga, and without a doubt, I can confidently say that she is the best DPO I have ever had the privilege of collaborating with. 
Olga possesses an unparalleled set of skills that make navigating the complexities of GDPR seem effortless. Her in-depth understanding of data protection regulations, coupled with her strategic approach, has made compliance not only achievable but also streamlined for the organisation.
What sets Olga apart is her ability to demystify the intricacies of GDPR, making it comprehensible and accessible to everyone. Her commitment to creating a culture of data privacy is truly commendable, and under her guidance, the organisation saw a remarkable improvement in our data protection practices.‚Äù\n

‚ÄúOlga's approach to the tasks and collaboration in general was constructive, energetic, positive and visionary.‚Äù

    title: "Any advice for aspiring professionals in this field?",
    content: `First of all, it is not necessary to be a lawyer to work in this field.\nBut please, don‚Äôt just work in this field because it is trendy!\nHowever, having a significant interest and dedication to this field is important to succeed.\n\nWorking in this field requires continuous learning and skill development, as well as extensive networking within and outside the organization.\nThere is much to consider in this field, and understanding GDPR alone is not sufficient for success.\nThis is what I always communicate to my mentees.\n\nNaturally, this varies based on each individual's unique personality and aspirations.`
